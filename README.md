Get a newsletter summarized by GPT from multiple RSS sources.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. You will need to have a OpenAI API key. Set it as an environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
4. Run `python main.py` to start the server.

Note: now the script is only a MVP, it is only a CLI that prints the output to the console.
